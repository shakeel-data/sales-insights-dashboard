## 🪜 Project Workflow
### 1. 📝 Data Acquisition and Preparation
**Identify and Access Data Sources:** 
  - Opening XLXS file.
  - Copying and pasting data from various sources.

### 2. 🔍 Initial Data Exploration
likely reviewed the raw data to understand its structure, identify potential issues (missing values, inconsistencies, errors), and get a feel for the variables.

### 3. 🧹 Data Cleaning
**Took actions to improve the quality of your data, such as:**
- **Handling Missing Values:** Deciding whether to remove rows/columns with missing data or impute values.
- **Correcting Errors:** Fixing typos, inconsistencies in formatting, and inaccurate entries.
- **Standardizing Data:** Ensuring consistent formatting for dates, text, and numerical values.
- **Removing Duplicates:** Identifying and eliminating redundant records.

### 4. 🔄 Data Transformation
**Manipulated the data to make it suitable for analysis and visualization:**
- **Filtering Data:** Selecting specific subsets of data based on criteria (e.g., specific years, customer types).
- **Sorting Data:** Arranging data in a specific order for easier analysis.
- **Creating New Columns/Calculated Fields:** Deriving new information from existing columns (e.g., calculating profit margins, creating date parts like month or year).
- **Aggregating Data:** Summarizing data (e.g., calculating total sales per region, average order value).
- **Pivoting/Unpivoting Data:** Reshaping the data structure for better analysis and visualization (potentially using Excel's PivotTable or Power Query).
- **Joining/Combining Data:** Merging data from multiple sources based on common fields (potentially using VLOOKUP, XLOOKUP, or Power Query).

### 5. 🪟 Dashboard Creation in Excel
- **Select Key Metrics:**
  - Identified the most important metrics to display on dashboard (e.g., Total Profits, Total Sales, Sales by Region, Sales by Category, etc.).
- **Choose Appropriate Visualizations:**
  - Excel chart types that best represent data and insights (e.g., bar charts for comparisons, line charts for trends, pie charts for proportions, maps if using Power Map for geographical data, tables for detailed figures).
- **Create Charts and Tables:**
  - Used Excel's charting tools and table features to generate the visualizations for each key metric.
- **Implement Interactivity (using Excel features):**
  - **Slicers:** Connected to PivotTables to allow dynamic filtering of the data displayed in the charts and tables.
  - **Filters:** Utilizing the built-in filter functionality of Excel Tables or PivotTables.
  - **PivotCharts:** Creating charts directly from PivotTables, enabling dynamic data exploration.
  - **Dropdown Menus (Data Validation):** Potentially used for selecting specific categories or time periods.
- **Design Dashboard Layout:** Arranged the charts, tables, and interactive elements on one or more Excel sheets to create a cohesive and informative dashboard. This likely involved:
  - Strategic placement of key metrics.
  - Using formatting (colors, borders, fonts) to improve readability and visual appeal.
  - Adding titles and labels to clearly communicate the information.
